<p>Over the past few weeks we have been working hard on several new coloring books that will be live in the next few days. Here&#8217;s a preview:</p>



<h2>Halloween Jokes Coloring Book</h2>



<p>This is a fun coloring book with 100 pages and 50 coloring activities. Each activity page has a funny (punny?) Halloween joke. Watch out parents, some of these are real groaners. The activity pages each have a fun, Halloween-themed coloring image too. </p>



<h2>Four Seasons Coloring Book</h2>



<p>This is a passion project of mine. I love the change of the seasons and have been working on a project related to it for quite some time. Each span (right and left pages) has an inspirational quote and a custom coloring area. The quote theme is the changing of the seasons. </p>
